                        <img src="images/treatment.jpg"></img>
                        <p>Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some of these drugs are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections.</p>
                        <h2>Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Insulin is the main treatment for type 1 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn’t able to produce.</p>
                        <p>There are four types of insulin that are most commonly used. They’re differentiated by how quickly they start to work, and how long their effects last:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
                            <li>Short-acting insulin starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 6 to 8 hours.</li>
                            <li>Intermediate-acting insulin starts to work within 1 to 2 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours.</li>
                            <li>Long-acting insulin starts to work a few hours after injection and lasts 24 hours or longer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your blood sugar, you’ll need to take medication.</p>
                        <p>These drugs lower your blood sugar in a variety of ways:</p>

                        <p>You may need to take more than one of these drugs. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin.</p>
                        <h2>Gestational Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>You’ll need to monitor your blood sugar level several times a day during pregnancy. If it’s high, dietary changes and exercise may or may not be enough to bring it down.</p>
                        <p>According to the Mayo Clinic, about 10 to 20 percent of women with gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the growing baby.</p>
                        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                        <p>The drug or combination of drugs that your doctor prescribes will depend on the type of diabetes you have — and its cause. Check out this list of the various medications that are available to treat diabetes.</p>
