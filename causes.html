                        <p>Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.</p>
                        <h2>Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.</p>
                        <p>Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.</p>
                        <h2>Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.</p>
                        <p>This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.</p>
                        <h2>Gestational Diabetes</h2>
                        <p>Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Women who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.</p>
                        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                        <p>Both genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering diabetes. Get more information here on the causes of diabetes.</p>
